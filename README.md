Initial Game Idea: Create a game where you are in a sub-nautic pod that slowly descends through the ocean, but the twist is the pod is able to move past the deepest humanly possible point and so the player is the first human to descend to the deepest parts of the ocean, regular aquatic creatures as well as new sea monsters will appear and the player will have to maintain and repair the pod while descending, the final task the player will have to go outside of the pod and do tasks to prepare the pod to ascend but the catch is the player has to do all of this while an enormous sea creature is slowly gaining and watching (radar to detect Cthulhu).
